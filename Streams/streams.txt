STREAMS AND BUFFERS:

Streams in Node.js are a way to handle continuous flow of data.
They enable reading or writing data piece by piece instead of loading
the entire data into memory.
A Buffer in Node.js is a temporary storage area for binary data.
Buffers work as chunks of data, enabling efficient data manipulation in
streams.
It helps to decrease memory consumption of your web server.
There are four types of streams in Node.js: Writeable, Readable, Duplex,
and Transform. But we won't cover everything in detail, as that would
take a separate course if we wanted. We will teach what is needed for
now.
